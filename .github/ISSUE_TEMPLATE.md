# Before creating an issue
  * check the [documentation](https://www.spn.org/developers/)
  * ask for help
    * There is a [Stellar Stack Exchange](https://spn.stackexchange.com/)
    * For more general questions, discuss with [the community](https://www.spn.org/community/) (Slack, forums, Reddit, ...)
  * check existing and closed issues (you may have to remove the `is:open` filter)
    * check that the version that you are running is newer than the one with the fix
    * re-open an old issue that is supposed to be fixed; be sure to include additional details

Issues opened here are to report actual problems with spn-core; any other issues (general questions, issues unrelated to spn-core) will be closed (sorry - we have only a small community of people that manage issues).

## protocol changes
Note: a special category of issues are `protocol` related issues.

Those are typically requests to modify how the core protocol works (adding a new operation, changing the way transactions work, etc).

As spn-core just implements the protocol, changes in the specification of the protocol has to be done via the [protocol repository](https://github.com/spn/spn-protocol/issues).
