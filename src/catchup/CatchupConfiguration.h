// Each catchup can be configured by two parameters destination ledger and count
// of ledgers to apply.
// Value of count can be adjusted in different ways during catchup. If applying
// count ledgers would mean going before the last closed ledger - it is
// reduced. Otherwise it can be slightly enlarged (by at most checkpoint
// frequency value) to ensure, that at least count ledgers are applied.
//
// Different values of CatchupConfiguration give the same results as old
// catchup modes:
// - CATCHUP_MINIMAL - count set to 0
// - CATCHUP_COMPLETE - count set to UINT32_MAX
// - CATCHUP_RECENT - count set to recent value
//
// Value of destination ledger can be also set to CatchupConfiguration::CURRENT
// which means that CatchupWork will get latest checkpoint from history archive
// and catchup to that instead of destination ledger. This is usefull when
// doing offline commandline catchups with spn-core catchup command.
