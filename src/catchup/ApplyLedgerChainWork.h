/**
 * This class is responsible for applying transactions stored in files on
 * temporary directory (downloadDir) to local ledger. It requires two sets of
 * files - ledgers and transactions - int .xdr format. Transaction files are
 * used to read transactions that will be used and ledger files are used to
 * check if ledger hashes are matching.
 *
 * In each run it skips or applies transactions from one ledger. Skipping occurs
 * when ledger to by applied is older than LCL from local ledger. At LCL
 * boundary checks are made
 * to confirm that ledgers from files are knot up with LCL. If everything is OK,
 * an apply ledger operation is performed. Then another check is made - if new
 * local ledger matches corresponding ledger from file.
 *
 * Contructor of this class takes some important parameters:
 * * downloadDir - directory containing ledger and transaction files
 * * range - range of ledgers to apply (low boundary can overlap with local
 * history)
 * * lastApplied - reference to last applied ledger header (which is LCL)
