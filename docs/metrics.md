title: List of metrics exposed by spn-core
---

spn-core uses libmedida for computing metrics, a detailed description can
be found at http://dln.github.io/medida/

### Counters (`NewCounter`)
Tracks a value in absolute terms of a base unit.

### Histograms (`NewHistogram`)
Tracks aggregates (count, min, max, mean, percentiles, etc) for samples
expressed in arbitrary base unit.

### Timers (`NewTimer`)
Tracks aggregates (count, min, max, mean, percentiles, etc) of samples expressed in units of time.

### Meters (`NewMeter`)
Tracks aggregates (count, min, max, mean, etc),  rate (1m, 5m, 15m) for samples
expressed in base unit.
